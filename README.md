# Quotationtool #

`qutationtool` is a web application based on
[Zope3](http://zope.org). It was developed from 2006 to 2013 to
collect examples from literary and philosophical texts in a database.

Its status is final. It's not developed any more. Zope is dead and so
is `quotationtool`.

But wait! Yes. It's still alive. It is rock solid and after years in
production it still runs without issues. `zc.buildout` turned out to
be perfect for managing reproducible builds.

The repositories in
[`quotationtool`](https://github.com/quotationtool) are published for
documentation and archiving.
